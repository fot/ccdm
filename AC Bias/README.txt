----Welcome to the AC Bias HIT Persistent Plotter Tool----

Use Instructions
1) On a WINDOWS machine run the "SSR Dump Analysis Tool.exe" file.
    - exe file launches an ssh session into chimchim to start the script "ac_bias_hit_persistent.py"
    - exe file handles cleanup of launched item on chimchim

2) While running the script opens a chrome session that refreshes every 5 sec (This can be adjusted)

3) When done using the tool input "ctrl + c" (inside the generated window) to exit the application.
    - Exiting kills script on ssh side.
    - Closing the generated window without entering "ctrl + c" will leave the ssh session script running.
